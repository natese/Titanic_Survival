# Titanic_Survival
Analysis of survival rates on the titanic:
For this Tableau project on the Titanic, I explored how age groups influenced survival rates and examined whether children, teenagers, adults, and the elderly had significantly different chances of survival. I also analyzed how gender and passenger class intersected with these age groups to impact survival outcomes. Using age, survival status, and sex as key variables, the dashboard provides clear visual insights into these patterns.
